*Purpose*: We’ve been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates
through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying
real data. In this challenge we’ll use concepts like confidence
intervals to help us make sense of census data.

*Reading*: - [Using ACS Estimates and Margin of
Error](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html)
(Optional, see the PDF on the page) - [Patterns and Causes of
Uncertainty in the American Community
Survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622813002518?casa_token=VddzQ1-spHMAAAAA:FTq92LXgiPVloJUVjnHs8Ma1HwvPigisAYtzfqaGbbRRwoknNq56Y2IzszmGgIGH4JAPzQN0)

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates
is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF
link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_)
for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as ‘\*\*\*\*\*’ (five asterisks),
> the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so
> it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for
> these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those
> in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau
recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as
zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

- `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
- `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
- Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
- Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and
  add the filename below.

``` r
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "./data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit
df_income <-
  read_csv(filename_income, skip = 1)

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Well done!")
```

    ## [1] "Well done!"

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the
task, we’ll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns
first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument
and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can
use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in
a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

``` r
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_pattern = "(Estimate|Margin of Error).*(\\d-person families)",
    names_to = c(".value", "category"),
    cols = -c("Geography", "Geographic Area Name")
  ) %>%
  rename(
    "geographic_area_name" = "Geographic Area Name",
    "income_estimate" = "Estimate",
    "income_moe" =  "Margin of Error"
  ) %>%
  glimpse()
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely
related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the
following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

``` r
df_q4 <- df_q3 %>%
  mutate(
    income_SE = income_moe/1.645,
    income_lo = income_estimate - income_SE*2.576,
    income_hi = income_estimate + income_SE*2.576,
    income_CV = income_SE/income_estimate
  )
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q4),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe",
    "income_SE", "income_lo", "income_hi", "income_CV")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

```

    ## [1] TRUE

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_CV) - 0.06236556
  ) / 0.06236556 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can
compare population with income.

### **q5** Join `df_q4` and `df_pop`.

``` r
## TODO: Join df_q4 and df_pop by the appropriate column
df_pop %>% colnames()
```

    ## [1] "Geography"                           
    ## [2] "Geographic Area Name"                
    ## [3] "population_estimate"                 
    ## [4] "Annotation of Estimate!!Total"       
    ## [5] "Margin of Error!!Total"              
    ## [6] "Annotation of Margin of Error!!Total"
    ## [7] "...7"

``` r
df_q4 %>% colnames()
```

    ## [1] "Geography"            "geographic_area_name" "category"            
    ## [4] "income_estimate"      "income_moe"           "income_SE"           
    ## [7] "income_lo"            "income_hi"            "income_CV"

``` r
df_pop <- df_pop %>% 
  rename(
    geographic_area_name = "Geographic Area Name"
  )
df_data <- right_join(df_pop, df_q4, by = c("Geography", "geographic_area_name"))
```

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for
`\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified
uncertainties: Let’s practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can’t* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here.
  - The 2-person families do not have a lot of variation across
    different counties.
  - 5-person families in Nantucket have a wide confidence interval. That
    might be due a fewer number of 5-person families in Nantucket.
  - The income of 2-person families is generally lower than 6-person
    families. This makes sense since larger families might have more
    people earning in the family.
- Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk
  county? Why or why not?
  - No since the confidence intervals are overlapping a lot. This makes
    it hard to distinguish between different household incomes. For
    e.g. the 5-person families interval falls completely inside the
    6-person families interval.
- Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
  - Nantucket and Dukes have the widest confidence intervals for all
    categories.

In the next task you’ll investigate the relationship between population
and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability
(e.g. variance) and sample size.

``` r
df_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= population_estimate, y = income_SE)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 819 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q7-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might
  this trend exist?
  - As the population increases the `SE` tends to decrease. This might
    be due to an increase in the number of data points for the income
    estimate which leads to a decrease in the error.
- What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of
  studying small vs large counties?
  - It is easier to draw conclusions based on the data for larger
    counties since the error is lower. This does not necessarily mean
    that it is a better conclusion since it is easy to generalize for
    outliers in larger data sets.

# Going Further

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! You have income data for every county in the United
States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

``` r
df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Loudoun County|San Mateo County|Santa Clara County|Wheeler County|Crowley County|Elliott County")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

    ## Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q8-task-1.png)<!-- -->

### Q8: How do the top 3 highest incomes counties in the U.S. compare to the bottom 3 lowest income counties?

(income rankings taken from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lowest-income_counties_in_the_United_States))

**Observations**:

- Lower income counties have larger confidence intervals compared to the
  higher income counties. This adds on to the standard error observation
  we made since the higher income counties also have a higher
  population.
- The upper bound of the confidence intervals of the lowest income
  counties is almost equal to the lower bound of the confidence
  intervals of the highest income counties. This implies that the
  highest median income family of the lowest income counties is likely
  to fall under the lower end of incomes of the highest income counties.
- Highest income counties follow the general trend of more-person
  families having a higher median income. This is not the case of the
  lowest income counties.

Ideas:

- Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places
  you’ve lived, places you’ve been, places in the US that are
  interesting to you.
- In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
  - Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
  - Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of
    each category are in each county.
- Your own idea!
